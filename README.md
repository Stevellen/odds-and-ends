# Odds and Ends

This repo is where I dump all my homeless bits of code. There is no overall theme or organization to this, and it's mostly things I did for fun or because I saw a numberphile video or something.

*NOTE*: The sandpile.cpp currently assumes a Windows platform because that's what I mostly use (a crime to some, I know).
